This seminar looks at two bestselling nineteenth-century American authors whose works made the subject of slavery popular among mainstream readers. _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ by Harriet Beecher Stowe and _The Adventures of_ _Huckleberry Finn_ by Mark Twain have subsequently become canonized and reviled, embraced and banned by individuals and groups at both ends of the political and cultural spectrum and everywhere in between.
